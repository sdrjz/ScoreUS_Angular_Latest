                                The Scorecard is a tool designed to assess the performance of closed purchase orders in your ERP system, helping you evaluate key procurement metrics such as On-Time Delivery (OTD), Non-Conforming Material (NCR), Purchase Price Variance (PPV), and Lead Time Accuracy (LTA). By reviewing past performance, the Scorecard allows you to identify potential issues, take proactive actions to prevent them, and make informed decisions to improve future procurement performance. The goal of the Scorecard is to provide valuable insights that help prevent recurring problems, refine procurement processes, and ensure better decision-making for future purchasing activities.

                            <h5 class="mb-3" style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC1A20;">Getting Started</h5>
                            <p class="mb-3 aboutservicep">
                                To get started with the Scorecard, the first step is to assign an Administrator to manage the system. The Administrator is responsible for overseeing the routine uploading of raw data and configuring KPI parameters. Specifically, the Administrator's responsibilities include:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="mb-4 aboutservicep">
                                <li>Ensuring that the five raw data tables and five target sheets are up to date.</li>
                                <li>Setting appropriate performance targets for procurement stakeholders.</li>
                                <li>Configuring the four indicators and their respective weightings based on your organization's needs.</li>
                                <li>Configuring additional options, such as accepting early deliveries, determining the price variance day range, and selecting line chart report options.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p class="mb-3 aboutservicep">
                                The Admin account is essential for the effective operation of the Scorecard app. It holds exclusive permissions to upload raw data, adjust KPI settings, and configure key parameters. User accounts, on the other hand, can only view the data and settings behind the Scorecard.
                            </p>

                            <p class="mb-4 aboutservicep">
                                It's important to note that there can only be one Admin account per organization, but multiple user accounts can be added. The Admin account is typically the one that subscribes to the Scorecard service and is responsible for managing the raw data tables and KPI parameters.
                            </p>

                            <h5 class="mb-3" style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC1A20;">Recommended Approach:</h5>
                            <p class="mb-3 aboutservicep">
                                It’s advisable to start with the top 10 vendors with their corresponding buyers and commodities. This allows you to familiarize yourself with the system before expanding to additional vendors. If you intend to use the Commodity Scorecard feature for comparison, it is recommended to include at least two vendors per commodity.
                            </p>

                            <h5 class="mb-4" style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC1A20;">Familiarize with the Four Performance Metrics</h5>

                            <h6 class="mb-2"><strong>1. On-Time Delivery (OTD):</strong></h6>
<p class="aboutservicep">
    OTD measures how well vendors fulfill their promise to deliver orders on time...
</p>
<ul class="mb-4 aboutservicep">
    <li>Ensure that each Purchase Order (PO) includes necessary details...</li>
    <li>Require vendors to acknowledge orders and provide a "First Promised Delivery Date".</li>
    <li>The "First Promised Delivery Date" is crucial and should remain fixed.</li>
    <li>The default weight for OTD in the total score is recommended at 35.</li>
</ul>

<h6 class="mb-2"><strong>2. Non-Conforming Report (NCR):</strong></h6>
<p class="aboutservicep">
    NCR measures the quality of products delivered by vendors...
</p>
<ul class="mb-4 aboutservicep">
    <li>Ensure NCR records contain complete details...</li>
    <li>Involve qualified quality inspectors to minimize inaccuracies.</li>
    <li>Include the reason for the non-conformance in reports.</li>
    <li>The default weight for NCR in the total score is set to 35.</li>
</ul>

<h6 class="mb-2"><strong>3. Purchase Price Variance (PPV):</strong></h6>
<p class="aboutservicep">
    PPV evaluates how vendors adjust their selling prices over time...
</p>
<ul class="mb-4 aboutservicep">
    <li>Ensure you have relevant PO details such as part number, quantity, price, etc.</li>
    <li>Set a time frame for monitoring price variance (e.g., 90-365 days).</li>
    <li>Communicate regularly with vendors on PPV expectations.</li>
    <li>The default weight for PPV is set at 15.</li>
</ul>

<h6 class="mb-2"><strong>4. Lead Time Accuracy (LTA):</strong></h6>
<p class="aboutservicep">
    LTA measures the accuracy of the time it takes from order placement to delivery...
</p>
<ul class="mb-4 aboutservicep">
    <li>Ensure each PO record includes PO issue date, lead time days, etc.</li>
    <li>Educate vendors and buyers on accurate lead time importance.</li>
    <li>Base LTA on actual production lead time, not stock availability.</li>
    <li>The default weight for LTA in the total score is 15.</li>
</ul>


                            <p class="aboutservicep">
                                By familiarizing yourself with these four key performance indicators and understanding how to set and track them, you will be equipped to use the Scorecard effectively. These metrics will provide insights into your procurement operations, enabling you to identify issues early and improve the overall efficiency of your supply chain.

                            <p class="mb-4 aboutservicep">
                                On the Dashboard screen, you will be presented with the overall score, including individual scores and percentages for On-Time Delivery (OTD), Non-Conforming Material (NCR), Purchase Price Variance (PPV), and Lead Time Accuracy (LTA) based on the raw data you have uploaded to the Scorecard system.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-4 aboutservicep">
                                For example, if you have data from 2 plants, 3 commodities, 10 vendors, 5 buyers, and 100 materials, the total score and individual OTD, NCR, PPV, and LTA scores will reflect the overall performance across these categories.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-4 aboutservicep">
                                You will also have access to trend lines that track overall performance over time, with a default period of the past 180 days. This allows you to quickly assess performance trends and compare with the previous 180 days.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-4 aboutservicep">
                                Additionally, the Dashboard will show counts of vendors, buyers, commodities, plants, and materials involved. It will display how many vendors have created accounts to monitor their performance. Metrics like total spend, issued PO lines, received PO lines, and total sourced materials will be visible and can be compared to previous periods.

                                The Admin screen allows for the customization of various KPI parameters to ensure your score reports align with your specific business needs. You can adjust the following settings:
                            </p>

                            <h6 class="mb-3" style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC1A20;">OTD, NCR, PPV, and LTA Parameters Option</h6>
                            <p class="aboutservicep">
                                Within the OTD, NCR, PPV, and LTA sections, you can set the desired percentages and corresponding scores for each metric. For example, if On-Time Delivery (OTD) is a key priority for your business, you can assign a high score only if vendors meet a 99% on-time delivery rate. Alternatively, if Price Variance (PPV) is more important, you may decide to withhold full scores unless vendors meet a certain price threshold, such as a -10% variance. These settings offer you the flexibility to modify percentages and scores as needed to reflect your priorities.
                            </p>

                            <h6 class="mb-3" style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC1A20;">On-Time Delivery Option</h6>
                            <p class="aboutservicep">
                                This setting enables you to choose how on-time delivery should be calculated. You have two options:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="aboutservicep mb-4">
                                <li><strong>Accept early delivery:</strong> This will include early deliveries in your on-time delivery metrics.</li>
                                <li><strong>Do not accept early delivery:</strong> Only deliveries made on the promised delivery date will be considered on-time.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h6 class="mb-3" style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC1A20;">Receiving Buffer Days Option</h6>
                            <p class="aboutservicep">
                                This feature allows you to account for warehouse processing time, which can affect the accuracy of on-time delivery calculations. By including a buffer period, you can avoid penalizing vendors for late deliveries that are caused by internal processing delays. The buffer period is configurable to reflect your specific operational needs.
                            </p>

                            <h6 class="mb-3" style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC1A20;">Price Variance Day Range Option</h6>
                            <p class="aboutservicep">
                                To calculate Purchase Price Variance (PPV), this setting allows you to specify the time frame for comparing current purchase prices against past prices. A default range of 90 to 365 days is set, meaning the system will compare the latest purchase price with prices from 90 days before the current purchase and 365 days after. You can adjust this range to fit your needs, ensuring that the comparison period is relevant for your procurement strategy.
                            </p>
                            <h5 class="mb-3" style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC1A20;">Line Chart Report Option</h5>
                            <p class="aboutservicep">
                                This setting controls the time period for the line chart in the performance report.
                            </p>
                            <ul class="aboutservicep mb-4">
                                <li><strong>Shorter time period:</strong> Results in more detailed line charts, closely resembling the raw data. However, this will take longer to generate.</li>
                                <li><strong>Longer time period:</strong> Provides a less detailed line chart and may distort the data, but will generate results more quickly.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="aboutservicep">
                                For example, selecting a 7-day period will result in data being calculated and displayed every 7 days on the chart.
                            </p>

                            <h5 class="mb-3" style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC1A20;">Report Sending Option</h5>
                            <p class="aboutservicep">
                                This feature allows the Administrator to set the default method for sending reports to relevant parties. Users can override this setting in the scorecard screen to choose whether to send reports for review before sending or to send them directly.
                            </p>

                            <h5 class="mb-3" style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC1A20;">Metrics Weight Option</h5>
                            <p class="aboutservicep">
                                The user administrator can determine the weight assigned to each performance metric (OTD, NCR, PPV, and LTA). For example, if on-time delivery is deemed more critical than price variance, you can assign a higher weight to OTD while adjusting the weights of the other metrics. It is important to ensure that the total of all metric weights equals 100. Any changes made to one metric’s weight will require adjustments to the others to maintain this total.
                            </p>

                            <h5 class="mb-3" style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC1A20;">Save and Reset</h5>
                            <p class="aboutservicep">
                                If you have made several adjustments to your parameters and are unsure about the correct settings, you can always reset the parameters to the original default settings when you first started using the Scorecard. This feature allows you to revert to the default configuration, ensuring you can maintain a consistent approach to scoring procurement stakeholders.
                            </p>

                            <p class="aboutservicep">
                                By utilizing these customization options in the Admin screen, you can tailor the Scorecard to your specific needs, ensuring that it accurately reflects your procurement goals and facilitates effective vendor performance management.

                The PO Manager allows you to view a comprehensive list of all open orders. These orders are organized by buyer, vendor, and material number. In the detailed panel, you can easily see the buyer and vendor details, the number of order lines, and the total value of these orders, providing a full picture of your open order status.
              </p>
              
              <p class="aboutservicep"><strong>2. Past Due Orders:</strong><br>
                The PO Manager highlights orders that have passed their confirmed delivery date. Please note that the Delivery Date refers to the latest date confirmed by the vendor for delivery, not the initial Promised Date. The MRP system schedules production based on the confirmed Delivery Date, making it crucial to track past-due orders closely. Regular communication with vendors is essential to reduce both the volume and value of overdue orders.
              </p>
              
              <p class="aboutservicep"><strong>3. Acknowledgement Needed Orders:</strong><br>
                When placing a new order with a vendor, it is important to request an acknowledgment to confirm the vendor's receipt of the order. The PO Manager will highlight orders that still need acknowledgment. Promptly obtaining this acknowledgment allows the MRP system to schedule production more accurately. During this process, be sure to request the vendor's first promised delivery date, which will be used to track their on-time delivery performance and cannot be changed later.
              </p>
              
              <p class="aboutservicep"><strong>4. Future Past Due Orders:</strong><br>
                Proactively monitoring potential future past due orders is critical for avoiding delays. The Future Past Due Orders function in the PO Manager helps you identify orders that will soon become overdue. This feature gives you the opportunity to reach out to vendors and address potential issues before they affect production.
              </p>
              
              <p class="aboutservicep"><strong>5. Lead Time Check Orders:</strong><br>
                Lead time information is vital for the correct scheduling of production in the MRP system. However, lead times can change due to factors like vendor capacity and inventory levels. The PO Manager allows you to periodically check lead time with vendors, ensuring that the system's lead time information remains accurate. It helps strike the right balance by avoiding excessive checks while ensuring timely updates.

                This section includes a bar chart that displays the percentage of each category (e.g., past due, acknowledgement needed, etc.) for all open POs. By quickly reviewing these percentages, you can identify areas that need attention, such as high past-due percentages or orders that require vendor acknowledgment.
              </p>

                Understanding the trend of open orders over time is crucial for evaluating performance and making adjustments. The Open PO Trendline screen uses a moving average method to track changes in open orders, past due orders, acknowledgment-needed orders, future past due orders, and lead time check orders.

              </p>
              <p class="aboutservicep"><strong style="color: #BC1A20;">Step 1:</strong> Download Raw Data Table Templates<br>
                Download the four raw data table templates from the PO Manager system and familiarize yourself with the required data for each column. Ensure that any existing data in the tables is cleared before starting.</p>
                
                <p class="aboutservicep"><strong style="color: #BC1A20;">Step 2:</strong> Retrieve Data from Your ERP System<br>
                Obtain Open Order, Vendor, Buyer, and Plant information from your ERP or purchasing system. Arrange the data according to the template specifications and copy it into the relevant tables. It's essential that the data is accurate to avoid any discrepancies in the results.</p>

                <p class="aboutservicep"><strong style="color: #BC1A20;">Step 4:</strong> Collaborate with Stakeholders<br>
                Meet with vendors, buyers, plants, and commodity managers to discuss the ScoreUs system and set targets for OTD (On-Time Delivery), NCR (Non-Conformance Rate), PV (Purchase Variance), and LTA (Long-Term Agreement) performance. Collaborate to develop a plan that ensures these targets are met.</p>
                
                <p class="aboutservicep"><strong style="color: #BC1A20;">Step 5:</strong> Maintain and Update Data<br>
                Keep the four tables updated as necessary. The Open Order Table should be updated daily, while other tables should be updated as changes occur. Designate an Admin User to handle daily updates. If your MRP system can integrate with the PO Manager system, manual updates may not be required.</p>
                

              <p class="aboutservicep">
                Once the raw data is successfully uploaded, you will be able to begin using the PO Manager. If your ERP system can connect directly to ScoreUs, you won't need to maintain the raw data tables manually. Our team can assist you with integrating your ERP system into ScoreUs for real-time operations. Please note that if the raw data is not up-to-date, the PO Manager may not provide accurate Open Order Status and will prompt you with a message stating, "No sufficient data, please update your latest open order raw data."
